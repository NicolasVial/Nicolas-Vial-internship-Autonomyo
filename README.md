# Nicolas-Vial-internship-Autonomyo
This repository contains all the code necessary for the proper functioning of the system developed during my Master's project at EPFL within the startup Autonomyo.

All scripts written during the project are available in the "scripts" folder of the project's "assets" folder.

The documentation of the project can be found in the "projectDoc.pdf" file.

The final report can be found in the Master_Thesis_Report_Nicolas_Vial.pdf file.
